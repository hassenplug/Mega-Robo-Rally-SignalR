add entity framework to setup


Generate c# code to create an editable table view of a game board, which can be edited a complete, self-contained example of an ASP.NET Core Razor Page (.cshtml.cs and .cshtml content combined into one file).

The application should use the existing simulate connecting to an SQLite database with a single table named "Products".

The "Products" table has the following schema:
- Id (INT, Primary Key)
- Name (TEXT)
- Price (REAL)

The page must perform the following actions:
1.  **Initialize/Seed:** Create the SQLite file and the "Products" table if they don't exist, and insert three sample products on first load.
2.  **Display:** Display all products in the database using a clean, modern HTML table.
3.  **Code Format:** Provide the full C# code for the Razor Page Model and the HTML/Razor markup for the view, demonstrating modern async database interaction.
